It also uses a API for the backend to store the data and call the funciton. User can login to the system after they have registerd themselves
to track their mobile phone from another device having the same applicaiton.Application makes easy to for the user as they can now where
their mobile phone is or was to get an idea of where to search for it.
 
 # AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
 
 # AIMS
1.	My project aim is to develop an android application to track the mobile phone of the user if it gets lost so that it would not 
be much of a problem.

# OBJECTIVES
1. To perform feasibility analysis.
2. To identify the requirement, needs for the application to be completed.
3. To learn about android programming and learn how to create and use API in android.
4.	To develop a prototype applicaiton that will help track the users phones.


# FEATURES
1.	Users can register to the system.
2.	Registered users can login to the system and start the application to strat trackcing their phones.
3.  Registered users can track their phones if they get lost.

# Rest Client 
An application program interface(Api) that uses HTTP requests to handle GET, PUT, POST and DELETE Data.
Rest Client can GET,PUT,POST, DELETE the data. GET means to get request of the data, PUT means to update the data , POST 
means to register the data and DELETE means to delete the data.

# Retrofit

A REST Client for Java and Android is known as Retrofit which is type-safe HTTP client. It is a library in android whose
dependency can be called and can be used in the android easily. It is a middleware for connecting the API and the Android Applicaiton.
It uses a URL to get to the API and uses JSON converter to parse the data taht is retrieved from andorid applicaition to JSON data 
and vice versa.
 
# GET 
Get is used to request data from a specialized resource.

# POST
POST request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message and most likely to store it.
# DELETE
Delete method is for deleting resources from teh database. The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI. 

# PUT
PUT method is for updating the data or the resources of the API. It means that it updates the value of the data from the database 
when it gets a certain resource from the application.


# Conclusion
Hence, the applicaiton Lost Phone Tracker was completed. It is a prototype applcation for tracking. It can track the locaiton of the user and store it in a database.
The user can have access to this data via the application when he/she inputs their credentials.
